# Facial Landmark detection

This is a CI/CD example of an evaluation report produced by `giskard-vision` which compares a set of facial landmark detection models based on the following criteria:

- Performance on partial and entire facial parts
- Performance on images containing faces with different head poses (estimated with `6DRepNet`: https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet)
- Performance on images containing people from different ethnicities (estimated with `DeepFace`: https://github.com/serengil/deepface)
- Robustness against image perturbations like blurring, resizing, recoloring (performed by `opencv`: https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
